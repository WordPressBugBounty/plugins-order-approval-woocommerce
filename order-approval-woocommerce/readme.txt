Approve or reject WooCommerce orders before payment. Manual order approval, email notifications, payment link, all gateways supported.

== Description ==

**WooCommerce Order Approval** plugin allows shop owners to approve or reject orders before payment is processed, giving complete control over the WooCommerce sales flow.
With this order approval system, customers can place an order without completing payment. The store owner or admin can manually review each order and decide whether to approve or reject it before payment.

**Sales process flow for new customer**

1. The customer places an order, and no payment is processed initially.
1. The shop owner or admin reviews and approves or rejects the order manually.
1. The customer receives an email notification:
    * If the order is approved, the email includes a secure payment link to complete the payment.
    * If the order is rejected, a cancellation email is sent to the customer.
    * This plugin is ideal for Cash on Delivery (COD) orders, high-value purchases, custom orders, and stores that require manual order verification before payment.

**How It Works**

1. The customer places a WooCommerce order without completing payment, and the checkout payment is blocked until approval.
1. The order status remains pending approval until it is reviewed by the store owner or admin.
1. The store admin reviews the order from the WooCommerce Orders dashboard.
1. The admin manually approves or rejects the order using the built-in order approval controls.
1. The customer receives an automatic email notification based on the order status:
    * **Approved–** The customer receives an order approval email with a secure WooCommerce payment link to complete the payment.
    * **Rejected–** The customer receives an order cancellation email notification confirming the order rejection.
